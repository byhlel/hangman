# Hangman

This is a simple hangman game project but quite complete

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [Random-Word](https://pypi.org/project/Random-Word/).

Eventually if you get an error you might need : [pyyaml](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)

```bash
pip install Random-Word
pip install PyYAML
```

## Usage

Simply run the program and the following should happen:

+ Ask wether you wanna be reminded of the rules
+ Ask for the numbers of lives you want (up to 12)
+ Ask for the levels of difficulty (affecting length of words)
+ Ask for letters until you find the word or have no lives left
+ Remind you of the number of lives of the player and the used letters
